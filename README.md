[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/phpatterns/badge/?version=latest)](http://www.phpatterns.com/en/latest/?badge=latest)

I have read the well-known book: [Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
 written by the Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides).

In order to practise efficiently I have developed all the patterns shown in the book in PHP language (programming
language used at work). Each pattern is documented and unit tested using [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de).
Like the book, it's a catalog of 23 patterns and you should consider it as a basis for learning purposes.

Found a typo? Something wrong with this content? Just let me know and please feel free to contribute!
